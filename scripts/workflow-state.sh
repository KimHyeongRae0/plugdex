#
# Per-ticket workflow state stamps — deterministic stage-order enforcement.
# Each completed gate stamps its stage into .docs/state/<TICKET-ID>.state
# (gitignored, append-only). Later gates REQUIRE earlier stamps, so the
# 9-stage cycle cannot be entered out of order (e.g. GREEN before RED).
#
# Stages (subset of WORKFLOW.md stages that have a deciding script):
#   preflight        stage 1  stamped by preflight.sh
#   plan-reviewed    stage 3  stamped by agent-review.sh plan (PASS)
#   test-case        stage 4  stamped by test-loop.sh after check-test-case
#   red              stage 5  stamped by test-loop.sh --red (RED OK)
#   green            stage 7  stamped by test-loop.sh (GREEN)
#   report-reviewed  stage 9  stamped by agent-review.sh report (PASS)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/workflow-state.sh stamp   <TICKET-ID> <stage>
#   ./scripts/workflow-state.sh require <TICKET-ID> <stage> [hint]
#   ./scripts/workflow-state.sh has     <TICKET-ID> <stage>     # silent, exit code only
#   ./scripts/workflow-state.sh show    <TICKET-ID>
#   ./scripts/workflow-state.sh reset   <TICKET-ID>
#
# Escape hatch (use only with an explicit reason, e.g. recovering a ticket
# whose state file was lost): PLUGDEX_STATE_BYPASS=1 makes `require` warn
# instead of block. The bypass is loud by design.

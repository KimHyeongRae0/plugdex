#
# Mandatory first step of every ticket (stage 1 of 9).
# 1. Verifies the project docs exist
# 2. Checks the environment (git, required dirs, node/pnpm)
# 3. Verifies the ticket exists
# 4. Stages CLAUDE.md + DESIGN.md + ticket to stdout & .docs/scratch/
#    so they are force-loaded into the agent's context
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/preflight.sh                  # load context without a ticket
#   ./scripts/preflight.sh PDX-001          # with a specific ticket
#   ./scripts/preflight.sh PDX-001 --quiet  # stage only, no console dump

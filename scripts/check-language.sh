# Build a locale-independent Hangul matcher (U+AC00..U+D7A3) as raw UTF-8
# byte alternations, constructed at runtime so this file itself contains no
# Hangul bytes and passes its own gate. A character-class range like
# [<hangul>-<hangul>] silently stops matching under GNU grep's C locale
# (caught by CI on ubuntu — the macOS BSD grep happened to accept it), so we
# pin LC_ALL=C and match the encoded bytes directly:
#   U+AC00..U+AFFF: EA B0-BF 80-BF
#   U+B000..U+CFFF: EB-EC 80-BF 80-BF
#   U+D000..U+D7A3: ED 80-9E 80-BF (over-matches to U+D7BF; still Korean)
